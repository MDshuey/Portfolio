With the quipu was stored 2 bundles of prepared blanks, 2 fragments of quipus, and 2 broken cords with knots.  One of the broken cords might be part of the main cord of this quipu.  The cord is, starting at its broken end, 16.0 cm, 1s, 9.0 cm, 6L, 20.0 cm, K.

With the quipu were 4 broken cords.  Two of them were W with finished ends, no knots, and lengths of 24.0 cm and 45.0 cm.  We assume that the 24.0 cm W cord completes pendant 86.  The other two cords were AB.  One had a finished end, no knots, and length 27.0 cm.  The other was broken at both ends, 37.0 cm long with 1 E knot, 7.0 cm from one end.\n***3. Pendant 44 was broken at 10.0 cm but a directly associated cord was assumed to be its continuation.\n4. Provenance: Huaura Valley, near Lima, on Santa Rosalia Hacienda.  It was found in the remains of a building that was probably an Inca tambo or an old Inca road at its entrance into the cultivated valley.  Close by lay the remains of a small settlement and community.\n5. By spacing, the quipu is separated into two parts.  it may have had additional parts as the main cord is not complete.\n6.

We are assuming that a 9.5 cm fargment stored with the quipu, broken at both ends, is its continuation\n2. The quipu, received by the museum in 1925, was part of the collection of Charles F Gunther.  Its provenance was stated as Peru.  The quipu was received by the museum in a basket made of woven reeds (13.0 cm x 6.0 cm x 34.0 cm).  The basket also contained 41 spindles, 55 sticks and needles, 4 whorls, 1 bundle of sticks, 2 skeins of yarn, 7 miscellaneous samples of rope, reed, and textiles, and 1 bag of unspun cotton fiber.  The color of the cotton fiber was similar to the browns of the quipu cords.  There is no statement as to whether or not the quipu was found in the basket and none of the yarn or fiber colors are sufficiently distinctive to associate them with the quipu.\n3. By spacing the quipu is separated into 5 groups.  By color and values the groups form 3 parts: part I is a group of 4 pendants; part II is two groups of 6 and 8 pendants respectively; and part III is two groups of 6 pendants each.\n4.

AS201, 202, and 203 are designated by the same museum number.  They are similar in color.  Five colors are used; one is on all three of the quipus and another is on two of the three.

Menzel in \"Pottery Style and Society in Ancient Peru\", Berkeley and Los Angeles, University of California Press 1976.  Its provenance is Ica.\n3. By spacing, the quipu is separated into three groups of 2, 4, 4 pendants.  Both pendants in the first group are color B.  Each pendant in the next two groups is color LB with one subsidiary.  The subsidiaries in the first of these two groups are LB. EB, or LB and EB mottled; in the second of these two groups they are all color B.\n4.

A cord fragment was tied to the main cord just before P19.  The cord color is B and it is broken at both ends.  Beginning at the broken end nearest the single knots there is a space of 4.50 cm, 3s, space of 8.50, 3L, space of 13.5, broken end.  It is unlikely that the fragment is part of broken P50, P10s1, or P18s1 because the knots would not be aligned with the others in the group.  The fragment\'s value (33) would make it unlikely to be part of broken P48 or the pendant that may be missing just after P35 (see comment 2).  These would be expected to have values less than 10.  When the fragment was tied to the main cord is unknown but it does not appear to have been done recently.\n2. A discoloration on the main cord suggests that another pendant was once attached just after P35.  We assume this in the observations that follow.

Because the color and texture of the cords are unmarred, any unknotting would not have been recent.  The kinks are sufficiently clear to be able to \"reconstruct\" the number and type of knots.  In no case does an actual knot cluster appear on a kinked cord at the level of the kink.  The listing contains the actual knots only.

This is one of several quipus acquired by the Museum in 1907 with provenance Pachacamac. For a list of them, see AS97.\n2. By spacing, the quipu is separated into 45 groups of 5 pendants each. There is a larger space after every 3rd group and a still larger space between the 21st and 22nd groups and the 24th and 25th groups.  Thus, the quipu is in 3 parts: part 1 is 7 sets of 3 groups each; part 2 is 1 set of 3 groups; and part 3 is 7 sets of 3 groups.\n3. All groups in part 1 have the same color pattern: W(with a W subsidiary); LB (with an LB subsidiary); YG; YB; YB:0G.  Groups in parts 2 and 3 have the same pattern for the first 3 pendant positions and then vary in one or both of the last 2 positions.  Calling the colors in the part 1 pattern C1-C5, the color patterns are summarized in Table 1. (See table in notes)\n4. In parts 1 and 3, many values are repeated in the same position in consecutive groups or in the same position 2 groups later. The former can be represented as Psub ij = Psub(i+1,j) and the latter as Psub ij = P sub(i+2,j). In part 1, these hold in 20 and 12 places respectively; in part 2 in no places; and in part 3 in 27 and 18 places.\n5. The values in part 2 are related to the sums of values in part 3. Position by position, values in group 1 of part 2 are related to the sums of values in the first groups in each of the 7 sets in part 3; group 2 values are related to sums of values in the second groups of each of the sets; and group 3 values to the sums of values of the third group.

Dorothy Menzl, one of the excavators at Chala, deposited the bag and its contents with Oscar Nunez del Prado in Cuzco.  Also in the collection were a set of 13 prepared black pendants tied together, a set of 48 prepared black pendants tied together with a fragment of a broken quipu, and several individual broken pendants tied together.  This collection is also discussed in Knot Records in Ancient and Modern Peru, C. J. Mackey, University of California, Berkeley, Ph.D. theses, 1970, Chapter 4, pp. 83-99.  Details of portions of AS061 and AS067 are further described by the author on pp. 259-262.\n4. There is some similaritiy of colors used in this collection of quipus but no one color is very distinctive.  For example, KB appears on AS062-AS066 and MB appears on AS059 and AS065-AS066.\n5. Top cords appear on AS066 and AS067.  In AS066, both common forms of top cords are used-those uniting pendant cords and those attached to the main cord.  In AS067, the only form used is attachment to the main cord.  Both quipus have thes top cords centered within groups of 8 pendants.\n6. AS063, AS064, AS066, and AS067 all have twisted end of the main cord knotted.\n7. Several of the quipus in this collection have restricted values.  AS059 has values 7-13; AS060 has values 1-8; AS061 has values less than 7; AS062 has vallues 6-15; and AS064 has values 0-10.\n8. Most of the quipus in this collection have groups that are set off by spacing and color (AS059-AS061, AS065-AS067).  However, three of the quipus also have groups subdivided in half by color.  On AS059, the first group of 4 pendants is 2MB, 2W and the second is all W; on AS060 the second group os 4 pendants is 2YB:W, 2W and the third is all W; and on AS066 some groups are 4 pendants of one color, followed by 4 of another color, while the rest are 8 of one color.'),(1000174,'1.

Larger spaces appear after the sixth, sixteenth, and twenty-second group.  the spacing, color patterning and values are best described by considering the quipu to be in two parts (Part I is the first 16 groups and Part II is the last 16 groups).  Each part consists of 3 sections: section A is 1 group; section B is the next 5 groups; and section C is the last 10 groups.  See chart on page 396 of the Ascher notes.\n5. Basically each group contains 7 pendants.  With the exception of positions 4 and 6, the color pattern is consistent from group to group.  For positions 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, it is W, MB, CB:YB, YB, YB.  Position 4, with one exception, is CB:YB in Part I and LA in Part II.  in Part I, position 6 is CB in section A, CB or 0G in section B, and 0G in section C; in Part II, it is omitted in section A, CB or omitted in section B, and CB in section C.\n6. There is only one subsidiary on one pendant ont he entire quipu.\n7. (a) The values in section A are, in general, position by position, the sum of the values in the five groups in section B or the order of magnitude of the sums.  This is presented in Table 1 below.  See page 396 of the Ascher notes.  \n(c) In only one case is a value in section B the exact sum of the 10 values in section C in the comparable position.  This occurs in Part I position 6.  The value in position 6 in the second group of section B is the sum of the 10 values in position 6 in section C.\n(d) In Part I, for pendant positions 1, 2, 3, the following holds: there is a consistent ratio of (the sum of the values in the 5 groups in section B) / (the sum of the values in the last 5 groups in section C).  The ratio is 11.83 +/- 1.4%.  Similarly in Part II, posisiton 1, the ratio is 11.84.  (Positions 2 and 3 of Part II conatin breakage.  From what remains, it can be seen that the ratio does not hold for position 2, but might for position 3.)\n8. The relative magnitude of values in comparable groups in Parts I and II is consistent for positions 1, 2, and 3.  For each of the 16 groups, the values in Part I are greater than the values in Part II in positions 1 and 3, and values in Part II are greater in position 2.\n9. There are some additional relationships between sums of 5 consecutive groups in section C of the quipu.  If P (ijk) represents the value of the pendant in the ith part (i=1,2), the jth group of section C (j=1,2,...,10), and the kth position in the group (k=1,2,...,7), the relationships can be represented as follows: (see page 398 of the Ascher notes).\n10. AS068 and AS047 are associated.  For a detailed discussion see AS047.'),(1000182,'1. Construction note: The main cord was formed into a loop from which the pendants were suspended.  The loop was constructed by putting the end of the main cord though the stands of the main cord.\nSee Ascher notes page 310.\n2. The Museum records the provenance as Hacienda Ullujalla y Callengo.  All of the quipus AS051-056 have the same attribution.\n3. The only regularity noted is that P2 + P3 = 29.109 and P1 = 29.49.'),(1000183,'1. Construction note: Each of these knots has a short cord tied through it.  The cords are about 2.0 cm long and are color YB:0G (on P1, 2, 4, 65, 67, 85-88, 108, 128, 130) or W (on P5-9, 69, 72, 73, 91, 93, 114, 133, 135).  They are attached at the bottom of the knots.  Figure 1 shows an example of an attachement to a 3L knot. (See Ascher notes page 340.)\n2. Construction note: The main cord begins with a fringed woven ball. (See Ascher notes page 341.)\n3. Construction note: (a) Markers are thick, short cords that are looped around the main cord, twisted about 4 times, and bound.  (b) In some cases (M3, M6, M11, M19, M20), the main cord has first been wrapped with YB:BB cord for a length of about 1.0 cm. (See Ascher notes page 341.)\n4. Construction note: Markers M32 and M39 each have a cord attached though them.  The cord are listed as T1 and T2 respectively because, as with the top cords, they are attached to the loops of the markers in the same way that a top cord is usually attached to the main cord. (See Ascher notes page 342.)\n5. Construction note: In addition to the markers, there are other exceptional cords attached to the main cord.  They are called \"flags.\"  All are blank, YB, and much longer or shorter than surrounding cords.  (Because of the slight space between F2 and F4, and the discoloration of the main cord, it is assumed that an F3 was in that space.)\n6. By spacing, the quipu is seperated into 24 groups.  Each group has the same basic pattern: BB, (YB, W, YB, YB), BB, (YB, W, YB, YB), (YB, W, YB, YB), BB, Marker, (YB, W, YB, YB), (FB:W with a subsidiary of YB/0G, YB, 0G).  In groups that have less than 22 pendants, it is 1 or 2 of the BB cords that are non-existant.  Parentheses have been used to emphasize that each group is made up of 5 subgroups, with the first 4 having the same color pattern.  As well as there being a marker between the 3rd and 4th subgroup in each group, there are as many as 3 markers or 4 flags between some consecutive groups.\n7. The flag F1, just after the 7th group, separates the quipu into 2 parts.  (i) The first part, consisting of 7 groups, has pendant values from 0-104.  With 1 exception, all knots on pendants in subgroups 1 and 2 are tagged (see #1 above).  The tags in subgroup 1 are YB:0G, and those in subgroup 2 are W.\n(ii) By contrast, in part 2, consisting of 17 groups, there are no tagged knots.  The values also differ.  With the exception of the value on 1 subsidiary, all values are 0, 1, 2, or 4.  Moreover, most of the values in subgroups 1-3 are 0, most in subgroup 4 are 1, and the values 2 and 4 appear only in subgroup 5.'),(1000184,'1. Most values are below 10; the maximum value is 61.\n2. Groups of W alternate with groups of different colors until the top cord occurs.\n3. Using 4 individual colors, 10 different colors are constructed,'),(1000185,'1. The placement of knot groupings follows no observable pattern.  Therefore, we assign no numerical vaules to the knots.\n2. The colors were not matched with the color chart and so the color names \"Blue\" and \"Red\" apply only to this quipu.  Also, the presence or absence of end knots was not recorded.\n3. Construction note: A loop of diameter 1 cm was tied in the cord as seen in Ascher notes on page 52.  Thus, the first 2 knot clusters (8L, 1s) were above the loop, the cluster of 20s was on the loop, and the last 1s was beyond the loop.'),(1000186,'1. Construction note: (a) A W colored cord of 11.0 cm was formed into a circle.  (b) This was attached to the main cord by passing it around the main cord and then through itself.  (c) A long W colored cord was then attached to it.  The resultant loop was 5.0 cm with a 43.0 cm tail.  Spaced along the tail are single knots and small (c) flags.  The flags are short cords, 1.0 cm to 2.5 cm in length, each with a finished end, attached in the same manner as + subsidiaries, colored either B or W.  Starting from where the tail is attached to the loop, it is arranged as follows: 4.0 cm, 1s, 4.0 cm, 1s, 3.0 cm, 1s, 2.0 cm, B flag (1.5 cm), 1.5 cm, 1s, 1.5 cm, W flag (1.5 cm), 2.5 cm, 1s, 2.0 cm, B blag (2.0 cm), 2.0 cm, B flag (1.0 cm), 1.5 cm, W flag (2.5 cm), 2.5 cm, 1s, 4.0 cm, 1s, 1.5 cm, W flag (2.0 cm), 1.0 cm, W flag (2.0 cm), 1.5 cm.  (See Ascher notes page 54.)\n2. The flags can be placed in 1-1 correspondence with the pendants carrying knots.  Pendants 1 to 9 are colored B, W, B, B, B, B, W, W, W.  The flags are in the same color order.\n3. Just as there are 9 pendants with knots and 9 flags, there are 9s knots on the tail.  The s knots and flags can be placed in 1-1 correspondence.  The s knots and flags are grouped by being interspersed with each other.  The 5 knot groups are of sizes 3, 1, 2, 1, 2.  The 5 flag groups are of size 1, 2, 1, 3, 2.  Hence, flag group 5-i corresponds to knot group i (mod 5) for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n4. See AS025 for similar use of flags and knots'),(1000187,'1. Pendant cord 1 is the sum of the values on the remaining 6 pendants.\n2. Pendant cord 1 has 4 subsidiaries which alternate in color.  The same color alternation occurs on the remaining 6 pendants.\n3. The last 6 pendant cords alternate numbers 1, 3, 1, 3, ...\n4. Long knots occur consistantly in tens and units positions.  No single knots occur.'),(1000188,'1. All cords are the same color.\n2. By spacing, there are 2 groups of 10 pendants each.\n3. All pendants (except the last one) have a subsidiary.\n4. The numbers on the pendants range from 0 to 7 with each value present at least once, anf the subsidiaries are 0 to 5 with each value present at least once.  Further, the sum of each pendant and its subsidiary is 0 to 8 with each value (except 7) present at least once.'),(1000189,'1. Construction note: 4*1 is a pendant 21 cm long attached to the bottom of pendant 4.  It appears to be a recent attachment.\n2. Construction note: The color designation W/RM refers to a white cord with thin thread wrapped around it.  The thread wrapping forms a 0.5 cm wide band from 2.5 cm - 3.0 cm.\n#. This quipu and AS020 are not, to our knowlege, associated, yet they are given identical numbers SA4034 by the owner.\n4. A photograph of this quipu appears in Locke (1923) Plate XL along with a new line description on p. 29.'),(1000190,'1. Construction note: In group 2, the first and second pendant are paired and the third and fourth pendant are paired by special construction. (a) A double length cord was bent in half, (b) and then slipped through itself around main cord forming 2 adjacent pendants. (See Ascher notes page 62.)\n2. By spacing, there are two groups of pendants.  All cords are the same color.\n3. Long knots occur consistantly in hundreds, tens, and units positions.  No single knots occur.\n4. The value of pendant 9 is the sum of the values of pendants 6 and 7.'),(1000191,'1. This quipu and AS018 are not, to our knowledge, associated, but are given identicl numbers SA4034 by the owner.\n2. By spacing there are 2 groups of 5 pendants each.\n3. Both groups have the same color pattern - B, W, B, B, B:W.\n4. Represent the value on the pendant in position j in group i by V (ij) where i = 1,2; j = 1,2,...,6. '),(1000192,'1. This quipu consists of 2 main cords tied together.  The main cord on each part is a different color.  Part I, by spacing, contains 3 groups of 9, 9, 8 pendants and Part II, by spacing, contains 4 groups of 9, 9, 9, 6 pendants, respectively.\n2. For comparison of Part I and Part II, the quipu is represented in Table 1.  Note that (a) When the numbers in Part I are compared with the numbers in Part II, of 36 possible matches, 5 are unknown due to breakage, 4 have no comparable cords, and 23 are the same.  In the 4 cases where differences are present, the value in Part I is larger than the value in Part II.  (In 3 of the 4 cases, the values differ by 1 on 1 pendant in each of the 3 groups.  The fourth case is a difference of 3 on a subsidiary.)\n(b) When the colors in Part I are compared with the colors in Part II, of 36 possible matches, 4 have no comparable cords and 11 are the same.  (The 11 similarities do not occur on subsidiaries and include only colors W, BB:W, AB:W.)\n(c) Subsidiaries occur in the same positions in Part I and Part II.\n(d) Although some colors appear in both Part I and Part II, BB and AB:BB appear only on Part I, while G0, GY, and YB:GY appear only on Part II.\n(e) In Part I, the digit 1 in the unites position is represented by a figure eight know.  In Part II, single knots are used instead.\n3. For comparison of the second and third groups within each Part, see Table 2.  Note that (a) In Part 1, of 9 possible number matches, 1 has no comparable cord and 5 are the same.  In the  3 cases where differences are present, the value in group 3 is larger than the value in group 2.\n(b) In Part II, of 9 possible number matches, 4 are unknown due to breakage, and 4 are the same.  In the 1 case of difference, the value in group 3 is larger than the value in group 2.\n(c) In Part I, of 9 possible color matches, 1 has no comparable cord and 2 are the same.\n(d) In Part II, of 9 possible color matches, 2 are the same.\n4. Comparing the first 6 groups to each other the values have the following consistancies in rank order:\n5. The last group has all 6 pendants blank and turned upward.  There might refer to the previous 6 groups (3 in Part I, 3 in Part II).\nSee Tables 1 and 2 on pages 71-72 in the Ascher notes.'),(1000194,'1. Construction note: Start of main cord is turned back and inserted through itself forming a closed loop of 1.0 cm.'),(1000195,'1. Fragmentary specimen: perhaps this is a detached pendant cord with subsidiaries.'),(1000196,'1. Construction note: Spaced along the main cord are s knots and small flags.  the flags are short cords, 1.0 cm to 3.0 cm in length, each with a finished end, attached in the same manner as + subsidiaries, colored W or LB or LB:W.  Starting from pendant cord 2, the knots and flags are arranged as follows: 2.0 cm, 1s, 3.0 cm, 1s, 2.0 cm, 1s, 3.0 cm, 1s, 2.0 cm, LB flag (2.0 cm), 2.0 cm, 1s, 3.0 cm, 1s, 2.0 cm, LB flag (2.0 cm), 1.0 cm, LB:W flag(2.5 cm), 1.0 cm, 1s, 4.0 cm, 1s, 3.0 cm, LB flag (3.0 cm), 0.5 cm, 1s, 4.5 cm, 1s, 1.5 cm, LB:W flag (1.0 cm), 1.5 cm, LB flag (2.0 cm), 2.0 cm, LB:W flag (2.0 cm), 2.0 cm, 1s, 1.5 cm, LB flag (2.0 cm), 1.0 cm, LB:W flag (2.0 cm), 0.5 cm, W flag (1.0 cm), 1.0 cm, 1s.\n2. Construction note: Spaced along cord 1 are s knots and flags.  the flags are 1.5 cm to 3.0 cm in length, each with a finished end, attached in the same manner as + subsidiaries, colored either W or B.  Starting from where the pendant is attached to themain cord, it is arranged as follows: 11.5 cm, 1s, 3.5 cm, 1s, 3.0 cm, W flag (1.5 cm), 1.0 cm, 1s, 1.5 cm, B flag (2.0 cm), 0.5 cm, W flag (1.5 cm), 1.0 cm, 1s, 2.5 cm, 1s, 2.0 cm, 1s, 3.5 cm, 1s, 2.0 cm, W flag (3.0 cm), 2.5 cm, 1s, 1.0 cm, B flag (2.0 cm), 0.5 cm, B flag (2.0 cm), 0.5 cm, B flag (2.0 cm), 0.5 cm, B flag (2.0 cm), 0.5 cm, 1s, 1.5 cm, B flag (2.0 cm), 0.5 cm, B flag (2.0 cm), 0.5 cm, B flag (2.0 cm), 0.5 cm, 1s, 3.0 cm, B flag (2.5 cm), 0.5 cm, B flag (1.5 cm), 2.0 cm, 1s, 16.0 cm.\n3. See AS015 for similar use of flags ans knots.\n4. The main cord has 10 flags; the colors of the flags are 1 LB, then 8 alternating LB, LB:W, then 1 W.  The interspersal of knots and flags separates the 10 flags into groups of 1, 2, 1, 3, 3 and separates the 12 knots into groups of 4, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1.\n5. Pendant cord (1) has 13 flags; the colors are W, B, 2W, 9B.  The interspersal of knots and flags separates the 13 flags into groups of 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2 and separates the 11 knots into groups of 2, 1, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1.\n6. The flag and knot groupings on both the main cord and the pendant begin and end with knot groups.  in total, there are 23 knots and 23 flags.  On both the main cord and pendant cord, any knot or flag group containing 3 or 4 of either is always followed by a group containing only one of the other.'),(1000197,'1. Quipus AS026A and AS026B are joined.  Their main cords are knotted together at 1.0 cm from the twisted end of AS026A (between pendant cords 2 and 3), and at 15.0 cm from the twisted end of AS026B (just before its first pendant cord).\n2. By spacing, AS026A has 6 groups of 2, 12, 13, 12, 10, 5 pendants respectively.  The order of magnitude of the values in the first group (29-49) is greater than the values in the other groups (0-13).  Within the other groups, values in position 1 are 8-13 while values in all the other positions are restricted to 0-6.\n3.  Both AS026A and AS026B contain the colors W, B, FB and their combinations FB:W and B:W.  There are colors that occur in AS026A and not in AS026B, as follows: DB, G, and combinations G:W, B:G, and FB:B.  Similarly, there are colors that occur in AS026B and not in AS026A.  They are: KB, GG, GG:W, B:GG, and KB:B.  These differences may be due to differential changes from the same original colors.'),(1000198,'1. Quipus AS026A and AS026B were joined.  Their linkage and a comparison of their colors are detailed with AS026A.\n2. Most of the subsidiaries (103 of 150) have one knot.  While some are single knots and some are figure eight knots, their positions on the cords are the same.  Both types have been interpreted as value 1.\n3. By spacing, there are 11 groups and 2 single pendants.  The color of the pendants in the first 2 groups is W; in the next 3 groups all are MB; and for groups 6-11, the colors alternate.  Group 6 is MB, group 7 is W, groups 8 is MB, etc.  Both single pendants are W.\n4. The groups that have 9 or 10 pendants (with the exception of group 11) have values that are similarly internally related.  The relationship is of particular interest because it involves halving.  These groups, discussed below in greater detail, are groups 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n(i) Each group can be described in terms of one value.  Calling this value N, basically the pendants in the group contain:\n(a) Where N = 8 (in groups 4, 6, 8), the value 8 is represented by a long knot of 4 immediately followed by a long knot of 4, rather than by a long knot of 8.  Half of it is one long knot of 4 (in groups 4 and 8).  By contrast, there is a double long knot of 2 in group 6.  It is the distributive axiom, of course, that justifies the use of these 2 procedures to arrive at equivalent results.  Namely, A = (A+A)/2 = (A/2) + (A/2).\n(b) Since halving when only integers are used causes problems for odd values, it is important to note that 9/2 = 4.\n(ii) Including subsidiary values, the values of the positions change but the basic internal pattern remains the same.  Since there are 0-3 subsidiaries per pendant position, there are more inconsistancies.  The values and their representations are detailed:\n(a) Comparison of the arithmetic in groups 1 and 2 again shows the two different orders of computation: 28/2=14 uses (A+B+B)/2 = (A/2) + (B/2) + (B/2), while 11/2=5 uses (A+B+B)/2 = (A/2) + (2B/2) = (A/2) + B.\n(b) The odd numbers present are 11, 9, 5.  note that 11/2=5 in all positions and 5/2=2 in 3 of 6 positions.  However, 5/2=3 in one position and is unclear (2+?) in 2 positions.  Also, 9/2 now equals 5 in 5 of 6 positions.  It might be that the representation of 9 by 4+4+1 is leading to this alternate result.  Overall, in halving 18 odd numbers, 10 of them are rounded down, 6 are rounded up, and 2 involve broken cords.\n(iii) The focus on halving is also seen by comparing the basic values of consecutive groups.  The values of N )without subsidiaries) for groups 6-10 are 8, 4, 8, 4, 2.  Within each group, the number of consecutive pendants with repeated values also shows a halving pattern: two have value N followed by 1 of value N/2; then 4 or 5 have value N followed by 2 of value N/2.'),(1000199,'1. Construction note: The first and second pendants in group 3 are distinct but structurally connected.  Pendant 10 follows pendant 11 on the main cord.  However, pendant 10 has been passed through the loop attaching pendant 11 to the main cord and so appears to precede it.\n2. By spacing, there are 4 pendant groups.\n3. Pendant colors are the same within each group.\n4. Colors of subsidiaries always differ from corresponding pendant.\n5. Figure eight knots or long knots are used in all positions.  No single knots occur.'),(1000200,'1. Long knots appear in thousands, hundreds, tens, and units positions and single knots are used for the digit 1.  Placement of knots along the cords are variable.  Hence, numerical interpretation is difficult.\n2. Colors of subsidiaries all differ from color of pendants to which they are attached.\n3. There are 7 groups by spacing.  The first and last are incomplete due to breakage of the main cord.\n4. Groups 3 and 4 have the same number of pendants and similar color patterning.  The colors of the 12 pendants in group 3 are 2W, 2GG:W, 8W while in group 4 there are 2LB, 2GG:W, 8LB.\n5. Group 5 can be a sum group.  The first cord in it (pendant 34) is related to the color of group 3 and its value is the sum of group 3.  The second cord in it (pendant 35) is related to the color of group 4.  If the value of pendant 22 is 101 instead of 110 and the value of pendant 35 is 181 instead of 1081, pendant 35 is the sum of group 4. (See comment 1 above.)'),(1000201,'1. The end of penant 43 is formed into a loop 1.0 cm long.\n2. Pendant 70 is mended at 5.5 cm. It appears to have been replaced upside down so the knot order is reversed and was 6s, 5L, end knot rather than 1s, 5L, 6s.  The value would then by 1?65.\n3. The main cord is mended between pendants 71 and 72.  Hence, some of the main cord and pendant cords might be missing.\n4. The Museum records the acquisition as Aankoop, July 1956.\n5. Using 6 basic colors, 18 additional cord colors were created.  DB appears alone, is twisted with W, is mottled with W, is joined with W in three different orders (DB/W, W/DB/W, DB/W/DB), is twisted with BL, and is joined with BL.  The DB-BL twist is joined with W and is joined with DB, while the DB-W twist is twisted again with DB, and the mottled DB:W is joined with DB.  LB appears alone, is twisted with W, is joined with W is two different orders (LB/W, W/LB), is twisted with BL and is joined with BL.  YB appears alone, is mottled with W, and is mottled with BL.  BL and W each appear alone as well as in the combinations described above.  BB only appears alone.\n6. By spacing, there are 14 groups varying from 1 pendant to 16 pendants per group.\n7. Groups 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, and 10 have subsidiaries and the other 8 groups do not. \n8. (a) Five of the 6 pendants in group 5 can be related by summing: P5 = P2 + P3 + P4 + P6.\n9.

The main cords are connected consecutively: AS35A to AS35B; AS35B to AS35C; AS35C to AS35D.\n2. AS35A has one group of 3 pendants with values seperated by a space from 13 blank pendants.  The 13 pendants are divided into groups of 4, 4, and 5 pendants by color.\n3.

With the exception of 1 addition pendant in group 7, groups 5, 6, 7 show the same color pattern (KB, MB/YB, MB:YB, MB:KB).\n5. Group 1 repeats the values on AS035A, and group 2 repeats the color and values on AS035B.\ncorrection for note 4: \"With the exception of 1 additional pendant group in group 7, ...\"'),(1000208,'i. There are 3 groups of 9 pendants each by spacing.  Each grop has the same color pattern and is divided into subgroups by color: 3W followed by 6LB.  Within each of the 3 groups, positions 2 and 3 have no subsidiaries, and positison 1 has 1 subsidiary.  Subsidiaries in position 1 are W, and the subsidiaries in positions 4-9 are LB.  Hence, W pendants have W subsidiaries, and LB pendants have LB subsidiaries.\n2. The 27 pendants value range from 0 to 108.  Many are repeated more than once: 0 is present 3 times; 23 twice; 40 twice; 46 three times; 63 three times; and 64 twice.  So, in all, there are 18 different values.  All 8 values that are 63 or above can be represented as the sum of two other pendant values and all 8 values 51 or below can be part of such an addition.  Also, in both Groups 1 and 2: P4+P5+P8=P7.'),(1000209,'1. By spacing there are 10 groups of 4, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 1 pendants.  There is some consistancy of color pattern.  LD appears in 9 of the 10 groups in posittion 1 and in no other positions.  Groups 2, 4, and 5 have the same color pattern: LD, RL, MD, LD:W.  Group 1 is similar, but with the colors of positions 2 and 3 reversed and RL:W instead of LD:W.  The association of position 3 in Group 2 with position 2 in other groups, and of RL:W with LD:W, is further seen when examining numerical relationships.\n2. The values in Group 1 are the sums of the values in the subsequent groups.  Where pendants of the same color are in similar positions in different groups, their values are related.  However, the sum seems to be more related to pendant color than position.  While other sum statements might be as valid, one which accounts for most values follows.

P(ijsk) is the value of the kth subsidiary on the jth pendant in the ith group.)\nInexact sums on subsidiaries of position 1 in Group 1:'),(1000210,'1. Distance to first pendant cord unrecorded.

Two colors appear alone and the 4 are combined 2 at a tmie into 10 others.\n3. The last 4 pendant groups are set off by color as well as spacing.  (The previous groups show no color patterning.)  The 4 groups consist of 2 groups of 5B each; then 2 groups of 7 each, with the first having 2W then 5BL:C and subsidiaries of B/LC on positions 3 and 5, and the next only differing by W replacing B:LC in both positions 4 and 6.'),(1000213,'1. By spacing, there is one pendant and then 10 groups of 3 or 4 cords each.  Each group can be viewed as having 4 positions.  All groups have the same basic color pattern: B, LA or LC, B, LB or LC.  Groups where one of there in non-existant have only 3 pendants.\n2. The first pendant position in each group has s knots while pendant positions 2-4 have L or E knots.  As noted above, the first position (colored B) does not exist in some groups.'),(1000214,'1. Pendant 15 was broken and knotted together at 11.0 cm.\n2. The Museum records the provence as Hacienda Ullujalla y Callengo (about 40 km from Ica).  All of the quipus AS052-AS056 have the same attribution.\n3. By spacing, there are 5 groups of pendants.  Each group has 6 pendants united by a top cord.  Within each group, the pendants and top cord are the same color.\n4. In all groups there are no subsidiaries on positions 1 and 6.\n5. The values on the top cords are not equal to the sums of the pendants in the group.  Two are more than the group sums, 1 is less, and 2 cannot be compared due to breakage.\n6. No information is given on both 20s1 and 28s1.'),(1000216,'1. Construction note: This is two quipus tied together.  Both main cords and all pendant cords are W.  The twisted end of the main cord A is bent back and slipped through the strands of itself forming a closed loop from which P1 and P2 are suspended.  The other end of main cord A is tied around main cord B. (See Ascher notes page 358.)\n2. This quipu is associated with AS059-AS067.  See discussion under AS059.  \n3. By spacing, there are 6 groups.  On part A there are groups of 2,3,4 pendants, and on part B there are 3 groups of 8 pendants each.\n4. The pendants can be segregated into those whose values are 15 or less and those that are greater than 18 as follows:\n5. Pendants 1 and 2, set off in a special loop, have the values 18 and 7.  These values are significant in that all values greater than 18 that appear on the quipu are multiples of 18 or of 7.  The multiples of each that appear are 18,36,54,72 and 7,14,21,28,35,70.\n6. In addition to the fact that the values in positions 4 and 7 of groups 4,5,6 are multiples of 7 or 18, they are also consistantly multiples of values in other positions.

By spacing there are 9 groups.  The first 5 groups have 4 pendants each and, with the exception of the first pendant in the third group, all have the same color pattern (B, W, AB, W).  The last 4 groups are basically 3 pendants each (the last has an additional final pendant) and with one exception all have the same color pattern (W, AB, W).  Hence, when considered as a whole, all 9 groups have the same color pattern (B if present, W, AB, W) but, by number of pendants in group, the quipu is separated in two parts.\n3. In the first 5 groups, long knots and figure eight knots appear in two knot positions on the first 3 pendants of each group.  On the 4th pendant in each group, there is the usual knot usage (single knot clusters in higher positions and long knots or figure eight knots in the units position).  Where double unit values appear, the higher value is a 1 and the lower values are 0-4.  The last 4 groups have no double knot positions.'),(1000222,'1. M1=R:FB:0Y:G0\n2. AS074-AS080 are associated.  See AS074 for discussion.\n3. By spacing and color pattern, there are 4 groups of 6, 2, 6, 2 pendants respectively.\n4. All pendants in group 1 are united by being the same color (BS).  Each pendant in the group has one or two subsidiaries.  When there are two subsidiaries, the first is colored GL and the second BS:0Y.  When there is one, it is one of these colors.  Similarly, group 3 is united by being one color (W) and each pendant has 1 to 4 subsidiaries.  The color pattern for the subsidiaries is consistant (0Y, BS, R:FB:0Y:G0, AB) although they don\'t all necessarily exist.\n5. The quipu contains only the values 0-7 and 16, 17.  Double unit values (L knots followed by E knots) appear but only in group 1.\n6. The values in groups 1 and 3 are related in reverse order.  Let P(1i) and P(3i) (i=1,...,6) represent values in groups 1 and 3 respectively and S(1i) and S(3i) represent the sum of the values of the subsidiaries in the ith position in these groups.

The twisted ends of the main cord and pendant 1 are linked together.  Pendant 1 is a long cord containing flags and knots.  The flags are constructed as follows: (a) 4 strands of cord colored BG of about 4.0 cm in length are passed through the pendant cord; (b) they are then knotted around the cord.  Knots and flags are spaced along the pendant at the following positions: 4L(4.0); F(4.5); 7L(6.0); F(7.5); 1s(10.0); 2L(11.5); F(12.5); 1s(13.5); 4L(15.5); F(17.0); 1s(19.0); 5L(20.5); F(21.0); 2s(22.0); F(23.0); 1s(23.5); 5L(26.0); F(27.0); 1s(28.0); 8L(29.5); F(30.0); 2s(31.0); 7L(34.0); F(35.5); 1s(37.5); 5L(39.5); F(40.5); 1s(41.5); 3L(43.0); F(44.5); 1s(46.0); F(47.5); 1s(49.0); 6L(51.0); F(52.0); 1s(53.0); 2L(54.5); F(55.5); 1s(57.5); 1E(59.5); F(61.0); 8L(63.5); end b (121.5).  These can be interpreted as 16 numbers set off from each other by the interspersed flags.  The consecutive values are 4, 7, 12, 14, 15, 20, 15, 18, 27, 15, 13, 10, 16, 12, 11, 8. \n2.

Also, both are given the same Museum number.\n2. AS087, 89, 90, 92, 93, 94 are associated in that the Museum designates them all as donated by Gaffron, and gives Peru as the provenance.  For a comparison of them, see AS087.\n3. The quipu consists of 6 pendants of color B.  Each pendant has 6 subsidiaries.  The subsidiaries are attached to the pendants in th same color order (B, B, B, BB:W, B, B) with one exception where there is a BB instead of a B.  Nine of the subsidiaries have a subsidiary.  They are all BB with the one exception where the color is B.\n4. The values on the quipu are all 0-8.  (No values of 5 or 6 are present.)'),(1000228,'1. The main cord has been reconstructed and pendant cords appear to have been restrung.  The color of the main cord and the spacing of the pendant cords aling it have, therefore, not been recorded.\n2. The Museum gives the provenance as Huacho.\n3. Assuming that the relative positions of the remaining cords are original, on the basis of some similarity of color patterning, we hypothesize that the quipu had at least 3 groups.  The remaining pendants would be pendants 8-24 of group I, pendants 1-24 of group II, and pendants 1-4 of group III.  Groups I and II would then have the same colors in 9 of the 17 matching position (P10, P14, P16, P18, P19, P21-P24) and groups II and III would have the same colors in 2 of the 4 matching positions (P1, P2).  Also, for groups I and II, the relative magnitudes of the values of pendants 19-22 are similar.  (For group I they are 7, 70, 270, 260 and for group II they are 5, 50, 240, 240.)'),(1000229,'1.

Both groups alternate colors internally.  The first is DB, W, DB, W, etc., and the next is B, W, B, W, etc.\n4. The only pendant values in the first 6 groups are 0-3.  In the last 2 groups the values are 0-10.  All subsidiaries have values of 1 or 2.\n5. The first 6 pendants in the last group appear to be the sum of the pendants in the corresponding positions in the first 6 groups.

KHipu UR035 is currently displayed in an arrangement designed by the staff of the Museo Chileno to most effectively display the structure of the khipu; however, to achieve this appearance required moving the pendant strings along the primary cord to give more room to pendants and pendant groups that were originally arranged differently (generally, more closely spaced together than now).  Thus, no interpretive value should be given to the spacing between pendants and pendant groups.  However, the museum staff insists that the order of pendants, and the total length of the primary cord, were not changed in the arriving at the present arrangement.  \n3.

By spacing, there are 3 groups followed by a single pendant, then 9 groups followed by a single pendant, then 6 groups followed by a single pendant.\n2.   Groups 4-11 are paired in size and color.

AS088 is also discussed by Nordeskiold (see Introduction, Table 3).\n3.  By spacing, the quipu is separated into 25 groups.  Groups 2-13 and groups 14-23 are united by values and color pattern.  Group 24 is separated from group 23 by a much larger space on the main cord.  Hence, the quipu can be described as in 4 parts: Part I contains 1 group of 2 pendants; Part II is groups 2-13; Part III is groups 14-23; and Part IV is groups 24-25.\n4.  Part II consists of 12 groups of 4 pendants each.  (The first group has an additional blank pendant.)  For every group, the color pattern is YB: W, MB, W, MB.  Subsidiaries appear only on the 2nd and 3rd pendant positions: those in the second position are YB and those in the third are W.  The values on the first, second, and fourth pendants of the first group are the sums of the pendant values in the corresponding positions in the remaining 11 groups.  The value on the third pendant is 14 which is 3 more than the sum of the corresponding values.  The values on the subsidiaries are not included in the summations.\n5.

In group 6, the first 3 pendants are one color and the last 3 pendants and top cord are all of another color.  The subsidiaries do not necessarily match the pendants in color.\n3.  Assuming the direction of the pendants are listed correctly, the value on pendant 3 is the maximum in all complete groups.  Moreover, in groups 2, 3, and 4, the value on pendant 3 is exactly double the sum of the values on the other pendants in the group.  \n4.  With the exception of a difference of 1 in group 2, the values on the top cords in groups 2-8 are the sums of the values on the pendants in their respective groups.  In group 1, there is too much breakage to make a comparison.  In groups 9-11, the top cord values are all 0 (or blank) but the pendant sums are not necessarily 0.\n5.  The values on the first 4 pendants of group 7 are the sums of the values in the corresponding positions in groups 4-6.  That is,\n6.  The packet containing the fragments of this khipu does not appear as of 6/20/2005 to contain all the fragments noted.

Ascher gives no measurements for lengths of cords or fragments for khipu AS096.  To preserve the linearity of the khipu for database entry, cord lengths have been assigned arbitrarily with the following criteria: (1) each group of 6 cords is 3 cm long (0.5 cm per cord); (2) each group of 6 cords is separated from the next group by 1 cm; (3) each fragment of the khipu is separated from the next fragment by 2 cm.\n8.

The subsidiary cord was not attached to the pendant.  Since the pendant\'s coloration showed that it was missing a subsidiary, the association is probably.\n**2.   The pendant attachment seemed to be a later repair.\n3.   Two detached cords were associated with the quipu.  They were both color FB-W.  One had value 2 and the other value 1.

It was given to teh Smithsonian in 1933 by Mrs. J. P. Compton.\n5.   Because larger spaces separate them on the main cord, the quipu is considered in 3 parts: groups 1-7; groups 8-17; and group 18.\n6.

The quipu was repaired and sewn to a cloth backing in 1974 by Company Estela.  Since the pendant fragments that were added to broken pendants on the main cord are not part of the original construction, we have considered the fragments as broken and then listed the fragments separately.  Several other fragments associated with the quipu are also listed.  Our subsequent analysis led to conclusions about the probable placement of fragments.\nFragments:\n2.   The Museum designates the quipu as part of the Collection Museo Historia 1928.\n3.   By spacing, there are 6 groups of 18 pendants each.  Within each group, the same basic color pattern is repeated: 2W, 2 mixed, 5W, 2B, 2 mixed, 5B.  For group 1, the mixed colors are B:BD for the first pair and B for the next pair.  In groups 2-6, the mixed colors are BD:W for all pairs.\n4.   a)  There are no subsidiaries on the pendants in group 1.  Group 4 has subsidiaries only on pendants in positions 1,3,10, and 12.  Groups 2-5 have 0-6 subsidiaries in positions 2-9 and 11-18 but 6-9 subsidiaries in positions 1 and 10.\n5.   Each group of 18 pendants can be considered as 2 subgroups of 9 consecutive pendants each since (i) the basic color pattern of the pendants and presence or absence of subsidiaries in positions 1-9 is repeated for positions 10-18, and (ii) the order of magnitude of the values of pendants 1 and 10 and their subsidiaries is larger than the others.\n6.

Construction note: Five markers are used on the quipu.  The first three have the same colors and construction, the last two differ from these and from each other.\n2.   AS074-AS080 are associated.  See AS074 for discussion.\n3.   By spacing, color pattern, and markers 1, 2, 3, the quipu is separated into 5 parts: Part I consists of 1 group of 7 pendants and Parts II, III, IV, V each consist of 8 groups of 5 or 6 pendants each.\n4.   The 32 groups of Parts II-V have the same color pattern: BS (if present), YB, YB, YB, MB, B.  The first position (BS) never exists in Part V and sometimes exists in the other parts.\n5.   Some numerical consistencies appear on the quipu.  (a) All values are 0-3 in Part II, 0-4 in Part III, and 0-5 in Part V.  (b) In Part II, positions 5 and 6 are all zero-valued.  In Part V, position 2 is always zero-valued.  (c) In the second, third, fourth, and eighth groups of Part III, pendants 2, 3, 4 are consecutive values.  (d) The following relationships hold for all 8 groups of Part IV: P4 is greater than P3 is greater than or equal to P6 is greater than or equal to P5, and P4 > P2.\n6.   The pendants in Part I contain as many as two or three values.  For example, 3s knots followed by 2L knots followed by 5s knots followed by 2L knots is interpreted as 32 then 52.  This type of multiple value is only found on this part of the quipu.  The 7 pendants in Part I also do not have the same color pattern as the other 32 groups.  This part of the quipu seems to be some kind of summary group.  Values in it can be associated with values in the other parts in several ways, none of which accounts for all the values.  For example, 15 & 12 appears on an MB colored pendant--the sum of the MB colored pendants in Parts II & III is 15 and the sum of the MB colored pendants in Parts IV & V is 12.  Also, if the eight groups in Part III are summed position by position, the sums are ?, 9, 12, 18, 15, 11.  Each of these values is found in Part I.\n7.   Part V is further divided into groups of 3, 3, 2 by markers 4 and 5.  These markers do not seem to be very carefully constructed--one is a prepared blank pendant--or carefully attached.  Since no space separates the third from fourth group and the sixth from seventh group, the markers may have been used for group separators.'),(1000344,'1.   The finishing knot on P10 is knotted around P11.  Thus, the end of P10 is tied to P11 at 5.5 cm. from the bottom of P11.\n2.   Small spaces on the main cord appear between some adjacent pendants.  The darkened color of the main cord at those points leads us to assume that a pendant was present but is now missing.  These hypothetical pendants are included in the listing but designated as missing.\n3.   By spacing, the quipu is separated into 25 groups but ends with a break in the main cord at the middle of the 25th group.  A marker on the main cord separates the first 15 groups from the last 10 groups.\n4.   At first glance, the groups seem to vary in size and color pattern.  However, when viewed as groups of 15 pendants with some positions non-existant in each group, the colors and values are repetitions.  The 25 groups of 15 pendants have been arranged in a rectangular table (see Table 1).  A blank means the position is non-existant, an M is a missing pendant, and a ? indicates that the pendant is broken, so the value is unknown.  A double line has been used to mark a change in color.  Where there is no color change, but just a color anomaly, the value has been circled.  Observe from the table that although similarities remain, there are decided differences between part 1 (groups 1-15) and part 2 (groups 16-26).  Also, within part 1, there are several changes after the 15th group and after the 12th group.'),(1000345,'1.   The main cord is mended beginning at 15.0 cm and continuing for 1.0 cm to just after pendant 51.  One or more pendants could be missing.  (In observations 2 & 4, we assume a pendant is missing between pendants 48 and 49.)\n2.   The quipu is viewed in 3 parts: Part I is 6 groups of 6 pendants each; Part II is 4 groups of 4 pendants each; and Part III is 6 groups of 6 pendants each.\n3.   PART I:\n4.   PART II:\n5.   PART III:\n4i* Group 4 is subdivided by color: the first 3 pendants are one color, the last 3 another color, and the top cord is yet another color.'),(1000346,'1.   AS074-AS080 are associated.  See AS074 for discussion.\n2.   By spacing, there are 15 groups and 2 single pendants (P55 and P68).  The single pendants are viewed as markers since there are larger spaces between adjacent groups where they occur, and because both of them are blank.  Hence, by markers and number of pendants per group, the quipu is separated into 3 parts.  The first part is 9 groups of 6 pendants each; the second is 4 groups of 3 pendants each; and the last part is 2 groups of 3 pendants each.\n3.   All groups in Part I have the same color pattern: BS, PB, W, W, MB, AB.  The groups in Parts II and III have the same color pattern as each other.  Their pattern is a subset of the pattern of Part I: W, W, MB.\n4.   The pattern of values on the pendants in Parts II and III are similar:'),(1000348,'1.   Primary cord tied into a loop.'),(1000358,'Sueltos for UR109:\nBroken at 4.0cm'),(1000359,'many broken strings'),(1000360,'1.   By spacing there are 10 groups.  Basically each has 8 pendant cords (group 5 has one additional pendant and group 9 has one less).\n2.   The groups show similar color patterns: in all cases the first pendant is W; with two exceptions, the second is MB; positions 3 and 4 are inconsistent but are the only positions which contain the combined colors (YB:LA, YB:W, CB:W, LA:W); with one exception, pendants 5,6, and 8 are YB or MB; and with two exceptions, the seventh pendant is 0G.  (This assumes that the extra pendant in group 5 is between the fifth and sixth pendant positions and that in group 9, position 7 is non-existant.)\n3.   Subsidiaries appear on all positions.  There are 3 to 5 subsidiaries on the pendant in position 1; at most one subsidiary in position 8; at most 2 in positions 2, 3, 4, 6, 7; and at most 3 in position 5.\n4.   Assuming an error of 1s knot on pendant 1 in group 5 (i.e., the value should be 109 rather than 9), in all groups the value of position 1 is greater than the values in the other positions.  Pendant 1 ranges from 83 to 115, while the rest of the values are from 0 to 59.  If subsidiary values are added to pendant values, this relationship remains as the range of position 1 is increased from 101-158 while the range of the others remain 0-59.\n5.   There are some relationships based on the sums of adjacent pendants.\n6.   AS047 and AS068 are associated.  They were labeled by the Museum with the same identification number.  They are also similar in color, groupings, and values.\n6. (a)  The colors W, MB, YB, CB, LA, 0G appear individually or in combination on both quipus.  No other color appears on either.  (It is interesting to note that our recording of AS047 and AS068 were separated by more than a week and by travels within Peru.  Our reidentification of the same colors, for what turned out to be related quipus, serves to support our constancy in color-name selection.)\n6. (b)  AS068 has 2 parts each containing sets of 1, 5, 10 groups of 7 pendants each, while AS047 is just one set of 10 groups of 8 pendants each.  However, there is some similarity of color pattern.  In both, for all groups, position 1 is W, position 2 primarily MB, and the last position is primarily YB.  In AS047, and in the set of 10 groups in the first part of AS068, the next to last pendant is primarily 0G.'),(1000361,'1.   By spacing and color patterning, the quipu is separated into 3 parts: part 1 is 3 groups, and parts 2 and 3 are 7 groups each.\n2.  Many values are uncertain due to breakage.

The twisted ends of their main cords are loosely tied together. Also both are designated by the same Museum number.\n3. AS087, 089, 090, 092, 093, 094 are associated in that the Museum designates them all as donated by Gaffron, and gives Perus as the provenance. For a comparison of them, see AS087\n4. By spacing, the quipu consists of 10 groups of pendants. Each group has 7 pendants, with the exceptions of group 4 which has 1 more, and group 10 which has 1 less.\n5. The values on the pendants are restricted to 0-15'),(1000366,'1.A detached pendant was associated with the quipu. It is color MB, has length 22.o cm with a finished end, and has value 0 (or blank). We assume it comes from position 67.\n2. Quipus AS74-As80 are contained in a wicker basket. The Museum designates this as given by Henry Reichlen and from the Nazca Valley. Further, AS74-AS79 are noted as from Inca burials, Ancon, Central Coast. The basket has a hinged lid and is rectangular in shape (40 cm. x 18 cm. x 11 cm). Also contained in the basket are 2 black (LK) wool cords of 408 cm. and 224 cm.; 27 prepared pendant blanks (12W and 15B) all 28.o cm..-31.ocm. in length, strung on a loop of cord (color B); 7 smooth pebbles; and 79 beans. The beans have been identified by Professor Lawrence Kaplan, University of Massachusettes as seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris, the common bean.\nBy spacing, AS74 contains 1 group of 5 pendants; 2 single pendants; 9 groups of 5 pendants each; a single short differently colored cord serving as a marker; and 8 groups of 5 pendants each.\n4. With the exception of 1 pendant (P1), all groups of 5 pendants have the same color pattern: YB, W, W MB, B. Subsidiaries appear only on the second pendant in the groups and all are colored MB-W.\n5. By spacing, marker, and values, the quipu is in 3 parts: part I is 7 pendants (1 group if 5 and 3 singles); part II is 9 groups; and part III is 8 groups. All pendants in the part II are zero valued (or blank); all in part III have values 0-10; and part I has larger values and 2 values on some pendants. On 2 of the double-valued pendants, the lower value equals the sum of the values in the corresponding pendant position in the groups of part III.\n6. We hypothesize that part I in some way serves as a summary of the other 2 parts and that the 9 blank groups indicate that the quipu is incomplete.\n7. Comparison of AS74-AS80:'),(1000367,'1. This quipu is in very fragmentary condition. It consists of 3 broken pieces that have been recorded together. The first fragment is one group and a top cord; the second is 4 groups with top cords and 3 top cords from which the groups have been broken off; and the third is a group that has been off. The broken group has arbitrarily been associated with one of the broken top cords (pendants 24-28 and T7). No colors can be identified.\n2. Construction note: Each pendant group is suspended from a cord and this cord is attached to the main cord. Hence, the pendants themselves are not connected to the main cord.\n3. The quipu is too fragmentary to determine if the top cords carried the sum of the pendant cords. However, none of the discernable values contradict this possibility.\n4. AS72 and AS73 are associated. They were found in association with 7 pieces of cloth and 1 pottery fragment. The provenance is Rancho San Juan, Ica Valley, Peru. \n5. Although AS72 and AS73 are both in poor condition, it is interesting to note that, although associated with the same burial, thay have different construction.'),(1000368,'1. Construction note: Marker M1 is a cord of 1.5 cm. tied to the main cord. It is color KB and is wrapped with cord colored SY.

AS69, AS70, and AS71 were excavated by thier owner, Percy Dauelsberg, in 1965. For a discussion of the collection see AS69.\nA marker on the main cord separates the quipu into 2 parts.\n\n'),(1000369,'1. This quipu is associated with AS59-AS67. See discussion under AS59.\n2. From the discoloration of the main cord, and by extrapolation based on the spacing of the complete groups, we hypothesize that this quipu contained 24 groups of 8 pendants. Each of the groups had a top cord. Of the original 80 pendants of the first 10 groups, only 35 remain and so the first complete group starts with pendant 36. Of the last 14 groups, no pendants are missing.\n3. Two loose broken cords were associated with this quipu: one, colored DB, had a value of 50; the other, colored AB, had a value of 14.\n4. Both common forms of the top cord attachment are present on this quipu. In groups 18, 19 , and 21-24, the top cord unites the pendants. In the remaining groups, the top cord is attached to the main cord in the center of the group. The first pendant of the 18th group (P92) is a different color than the rest of the group reinforcing the idea that this is a place where a change occurs.\n5. All pendant cords within a group are the same color with the exception of group 18 noted above and groups 16, 20 and 23 in which the first 4 pendants are one color and the last 4 another color. In 2 of these groups the top cord is the same color as the first 4 pendants in the group. The third group has the top cord missing so its color is unknown.\n6. Only 6 groupd have the top cord the same color as all the pendants in the group. Five of these groups are the only groups for which all pendants in the group have the same value.\n7. The color of the top cords for groups 8-11 (BB, W, DB, W) are repeated for the next 4 groups.\n8. With the exception of group 19, all groups that have all pendat values and top cord value present show the following relationship: (represented in notes by formulae)\n9. As noted in observation 6, five groups have all pendat values equal. The sum value on the top cord must, therefore, be a multiple of 8. In some cases where the top value is not a multiple of 8, the pendant values can be viewed as top value/8 rounded to the nearest integers. This is seen in groups 11, 12, 16, 23 where the sums are 50. The pendant values 6x6 + 2x7. Similarly in group 9, the pendant values can be viewed as rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. That is 150 = 3x40 + 1x30.\n10. Groups 17 and 19 both have the same relationship among the first 4 pendants: {P1=P2=X/4+3; P3=X/4+4; P4=X/4-10 } and as result { P1+P2=X/2+6; P3+P4=X/2 -6}. For group 17, X=100 and for group 19, X=112. Since group 19 is the only group for which P1+P2+P3+P4 does not = P5+P6+P7+P8, it is interesting to note that also P1+P2+P3+P4 = [top value/2]-6\n10. Groups 17 and 19 both have the same relationship among the first 4 pendants: (formulae)'),(1000371,'1. Construction note: These cords are W with DB twisted around for a short distance. P2s2 has DB twisted around it between 22.0 and 26.0. P2s1 has DB twisted around it between 18.0 and 20.5\n2. This quipu is associated with AS059-AS067. See discussion under AS059.\n3. The quipu has 10 groups of 10,11,39,18,16,12,8,8,8,10 pendants set off by spacing.\n4. Groups 1 and 2 are similar to each other in color pattern: (1W, 2DB:W, 7W) and (1DB, 2DB:W, 8DB). Also both groups have the maximum pendant value in position 2, value 0 in the last position, and subsidiaries of value 0 in the next to last position.\n5. Groups 3,4,5,6,10 have only blank pendants.\n6. Within groups 6,7,8,9,10, the pendants are unified by color.
